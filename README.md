# mahler-replicator
"Mahler-Replicator" is a classical Universal Turing Machine made of cellular automata. Its main purpose is to create copies of itself. It is intended to be used with the Golly cellular automata program.

Mahler-rep is notable because it completes a copy of itself 160x faster than Devore-rep, another self-replicating machine that comes packaged with Golly.

To run it, copy "Devore2.rule" into Golly's rules folder, open "Mahler-rep.rle" in Golly, and set the pattern running.
